# Virgo++: Interactive Proofs for General Arithmetic Circuits

This project implements the interactive proof protocol from the paper "Doubly Efficient Interactive Proofs for General Arithmetic Circuits with Linear Prover Time" by Jiaheng Zhang et al. Virgo++ extends the capabilities of the GKR protocol to handle general (arbitrary) arithmetic circuits with a prover time that is linear in the circuit size, making it both efficient and versatile for verifiable computation.
